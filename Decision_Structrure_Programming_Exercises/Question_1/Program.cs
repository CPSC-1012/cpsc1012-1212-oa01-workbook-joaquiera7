/*Purpose:  to flip a coin and let the user guess whether it's HEAD or TAIL and report if they
 *          guess correctly.
 * 
 * Input:   userGuess
 * 
 * Output:  coinResult
 * 
 * Algorithm:1) prompt the user for their guess if HEAD or TAIL (userGuess)
 *           2) generate random number (0 or 1)
 *              > 0 = Head
 *              > 1 = Tail
 *           3) Display result as well as if the user guess correctly
